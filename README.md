# arbitrage-bot
This project is a cryptocurrency arbitrage bot designed to identify triangular arbitrage opportunities across multiple cryptocurrency pairs. The bot uses the Kraken API to fetch live market data, processes this data into triangular pairs, and scans for arbitrage opportunities that can be exploited.
