<h1>What Are Smart Contracts?</h1>
Smart contracts are self-executing programs stored on a blockchain that run when specific conditions are met. They automate transactions without needing a central authority or intermediary. Once deployed, smart contracts are immutable and transparent, ensuring security and trust in decentralized applications (dApps).

In this project, I used Solidity, the most popular language for writing Ethereum smart contracts, to create token swap contracts that let users convert tokens securely and automatically.
