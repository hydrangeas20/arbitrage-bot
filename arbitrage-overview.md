<h1>What Is Arbitrage?</h1>
Arbitrage is a trading strategy where you buy an asset at a lower price on one exchange and sell it at a higher price on another, pocketing the difference. 
In crypto, price differences can happen due to:
<ul>
  <li>Network delays</li>
  <li>Different liquidity on each exchange</li>
  <li>Rapid market changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Since trades happen fast and crypto prices are volatile, bots are ideal for <strong><em>spotting</em></strong> and <strong><em>executing</em></strong> these trades instantly.</p>

<h2>Hereâ€™s how it works step by step:</h2>

Find three currencies, for this example I'll use USD, EUR, and BTC (Bitcoin).

Identify the exchange rates: On the market, you'll find the exchange rates between these currencies pairs. For example:

USD ðŸ’µ to EUR ðŸ’¶ (USD/EUR)

EUR ðŸ’¶ to BTC â‚¿ (EUR/BTC)

USD ðŸ’µ to BTC â‚¿ (USD/BTC)

Look for a discrepancy: Triangular arbitrage seeks to spot a situation where you can start with one currency (e.g., USD) and exchange it for another currency (e.g., EUR), then convert that into a third currency (e.g., BTC), and finally back into the original currency (USD) â€“ but with a net profit.

For example:

You start with USD.

Convert USD to EUR.

Convert EUR to BTC.

Then, convert BTC back to USD.

If you end up with more USD than you started with, thatâ€™s a profit! ðŸ¤‘

<h2>Why does this happen?!</h2> 
This discrepancy happens because the exchange rates between currency pairs in the market donâ€™t always match up. If you find a situation where you can take advantage of these differences, you can make a profit by executing the trades quickly before the rates adjust.
