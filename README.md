Crypto Arbitrage Bot is a Python-based automated trading bot designed to scan for triangular arbitrage opportunities across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. The bot identifies price discrepancies within different pairs on these exchanges, processes this data into triangular arbitrage opportunities, and highlights potential trades that could yield profits. Currently, it uses the Kraken API to fetch live market data but can be extended to include additional exchanges in the future.

<h1>Key Features:</h1>


Identifies triangular arbitrage opportunities by structuring cryptocurrency pairs into trading loops.

Uses Kraken API to fetch live price data for cryptocurrency pairs.

Easily extendable to include multiple exchanges for cross-exchange arbitrage.

Analyzes price differences across exchanges to detect potential profitable arbitrage opportunities.

Implements an efficient system for logging, structuring, and analyzing arbitrage opportunities.

<h1>Tech Stack:</h1>


<b>Python:</b> The core language used for the bot‚Äôs logic and API interaction.

<b>JSON:</b> For storing structured data (e.g., trading pairs and arbitrage opportunities).

<b>Kraken API:</b> Provides real-time price data of cryptocurrencies for trading pairs (with potential to add other exchanges).

‚ö†Ô∏è <b><i>Disclaimer:</b></i>
Most cryptocurrency APIs are not entirely free. While some offer limited access tiers, the available data may be delayed, restricted in scope, or missing critical real-time market information. For accurate and timely data  especially in arbitrage and trading strategies, a paid API plan is often required.

<b>Uniswap APIs:</b> Could be integrated in the future for decentralized exchange arbitrage.

<b>Hardhat:</b> For integration into Ethereum-related platforms or smart contract deployment if expanded in the future.
Hardhat is a free environment that you can test, simulate and debug your smart contract before you deploying it onto a blockchain.
