<h1>What Is Arbitrage?</h1>
Arbitrage is a trading strategy where you buy an asset at a lower price on one exchange and sell it at a higher price on another, pocketing the difference. 
In crypto, price differences can happen due to:
<ul>
  <li>Network delays</li>
  <li>Different liquidity on each exchange</li>
  <li>Rapid market changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Since trades happen fast and crypto prices are volatile, bots are ideal for <strong><em>spotting</em></strong> and <strong><em>executing</em></strong> these trades instantly.</p>

<h2>Hereâ€™s how it works step by step:</h2>

Find three currencies, for this example I'll use USD, EUR, and BTC (Bitcoin).

Identify the exchange rates: On the market, you'll find the exchange rates between these currencies pairs. For example:

USD ðŸ’µ to EUR ðŸ’¶ (USD/EUR)

EUR ðŸ’¶ to BTC â‚¿ (EUR/BTC)

USD ðŸ’µ to BTC â‚¿ (USD/BTC)

Look for a discrepancy: Triangular arbitrage seeks to spot a situation where you can start with one currency (e.g., USD) and exchange it for another currency (e.g., EUR), then convert that into a third currency (e.g., BTC), and finally back into the original currency (USD) â€“ but with a net profit.

For example:

You start with USD.

Convert USD to EUR.

Convert EUR to BTC.

Then, convert BTC back to USD.

If you end up with more USD than you started with, thatâ€™s a profit! ðŸ¤‘

<h2>Why does this happen?!</h2> 
This discrepancy happens because the <b><u>exchange rates between currency pairs in the market donâ€™t always match up.</u></b> If you find a situation where you can take advantage of these differences, you can make a profit by executing the trades quickly before the rates adjust.

<h2>Manual vs. Automated Crypto Arbitrage</h2>

<p>Crypto arbitrage can be done manually. A person watches price movements across different exchanges and quickly buys low on one and sells high on another. But this approach requires constant attention and quick reactions, which can be hard to maintain.</p>

<p>This is where smart contracts come in. These are self-operating programs that live on a blockchain. Once set up, they can automatically spot price differences and execute trades instantly without needing any human input. This makes arbitrage faster, more reliable, and available 24/7.</p>
