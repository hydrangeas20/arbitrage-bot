1. Pair Structuring Logic
This part of the code organizes all available trading pairs into triangular combinations. 
For example, BTC can be traded for USD, USD for ETH, and ETH back to BTC. The bot structures the loop and prepares it for analysis.

  # Create all possible triangular pairs from available symbols
def find_triangular_pairs(symbols):
    triangular_pairs = []
    for base in symbols:
        for intermediate in symbols:
            for target in symbols:
                if base != intermediate and intermediate != target and base != target:
                    triangular_pairs.append((base, intermediate, target))
    return triangular_pairs

# Example:
symbols = ["BTC/USD", "USD/ETH", "ETH/BTC"]
pairs = find_triangular_pairs(symbols)
print("Possible Triangular Pairs:", pairs)

2. Price Checking Logic
After forming trading loops, the bot checks current prices from the exchange APIs to see if converting from BTC → USD → ETH → BTC 
will result in more BTC than I started with. If the numbers line up, that’s a profit!
  
  # Simulated exchange rate dictionary (this data would come from the API)
prices = {
    "BTC/USD": 30000,
    "USD/ETH": 0.0005,
    "ETH/BTC": 33
}

def check_arbitrage(prices):
    try:
        btc_usd = prices["BTC/USD"]
        usd_eth = prices["USD/ETH"]
        eth_btc = prices["ETH/BTC"]
        
        # Start with 1 BTC, convert to USD, then ETH, then back to BTC
        usd = 1 * btc_usd
        eth = usd * usd_eth
        final_btc = eth / eth_btc
        
        profit = final_btc - 1
        return profit
    except KeyError:
        return None

# Run the check
profit = check_arbitrage(prices)
print("Potential Profit in BTC:", profit)

  
3. Profit Condition Check
The bot calculates a profit greater than zero after going through the loop (BTC → USD → ETH → BTC). 
This is incredibly important condition, I'm teaching the bot to recognize if the arbitrage opportunity is worth executing.

  profit_threshold = 0.0001  # BTC profit threshold (this can be changed!)

if profit and profit > profit_threshold:
    print(f"Arbitrage Opportunity Found! Estimated Profit: {profit:.8f} BTC")
else:
    print("No arbitrage opportunity right now.")
